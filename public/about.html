                <h2>About Genshin Impact</h2>
                <p>Genshin Impact is a fantasy role-playing game that was created by a Chinese company named miHoYo (now HoYoverse). It is free to play, and the gameplay is open-world with some perks such as being able to play with up to three other people at the same time called the Co-op mode. It also has a gacha wishing system which can be accessed after saving up enough in-game currency called Primogems for buying wishes, which could then be used to pull for the good characters and weapons.

This game focuses more on fantastical aspects, which is evident from the character designs and gameplay due to the main battle skills of the playable characters being related to elemental magic. In this world that the player spawns in, there exists seven different elements that every playable character can wield: Pyro, Hydro, Anemo, Electro, Dendro, Cryo, and Geo. When two or more elements are combined, it causes elemental reactions that can cause more damage in battle than with what just one element can do alone. Each character can only wield one weapon type which could either be a bow, polearm, sword, claymore, or a catalyst. They also each have three sets of combat skills: the Normal Attack, the Elemental Skill which has a cooldown, and an Elemental Burst which has both a cooldown and consumes energy. There are enemies which you can engage in combat with who drop loot which you can use later on for leveling up your in-game stats or use in crafting. They vary in difficulty, with some having more health or HP than others, while others are more resistant or weak to certain elements.
