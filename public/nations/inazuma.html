        <h2> Inazuma </h2> 

        <section>
            <h3> Overview & Short History: </h3>
            <p> As the Nation of Eternity and an isolated archipelago located at the far southeastern portion of Teyvat, Inazuma is known for its stormy skies and the strict rule of its Electro Archon, Raiden Shogun. 
                This region is based off of the Edo Period of Japan, which is very noticeable from the clothes of the NPCs scattered across the land, the style of the buildings within the main city and the scattered villages contained, and the Sakoku Degree that forced the people of Inazuma to go into isolation from the rest of Teyvat present at the start of Archon Quest of this region were similar to its real life counterparts. 
                The archipelago is separated into three main factions: the islands ruled by the Raiden Shogun, Watatsumi Island that worships Orobashi (Snake God), and the Tsurumi Island where the Thunderbird resides. In the main storyline, the Traveller learns about the Vision Hunt Decree of the Shogun and with the help of some Inazuman people aids in abolishing it. 
                We eventually find out that the Raiden Shogun was actually a puppet made to watch over the people created by the true Electro Archon as she meditated in a world created in her own consciousness, named the Plane of Euthymia.
