        <h2> Snezhnaya </h2> 

        <section>
            <h3> Overview & Short History: </h3>
            <p> Very little is known about the region of Snezhnaya, especially since it hasn’t been released in-game yet. 
                However, according to some NPCs and playable characters from Snezhnaya, it seems that it is an extremely cold area, where the weather conditions are so harsh that staying still for too long out in the cold can lead to someone literally freezing to death. 
                It is described to have perpetual winter storms, month-long blizzards, yet beautiful auroras appear during nighttime despite all the ruthless aspects of the region. 
                Snezhnaya is also known to have the highest level of technology among all seven nations of Teyvat. They also harbor one of the most notorious organizations in all of Teyvat: the Fatui. 
                This delegation of people are mostly made up of diplomats and military personnel, led by the Eleven Fatui Harbingers ranked by their abilities who are the strongest in the organization, together with the Cryo Archon herself, the Tsaritsa. 
                Unfortunately, the Fatui are known for their bad reputation and doing whatever it takes to carry out their archon’s will, no matter how cruel or underhanded their methods may be. Most people treat the Fatui with wariness and disdain, and their Harbingers with fear due to the possible threats their powers may hold. 
                So far, the Traveller has physically met with eight of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, with two of them now already dead, while one of them had been completely erased from the memories of the world. </p>

        <h2> Nod Krai </h2> 

        <section>
            <h3> Overview & Short History: </h3>
            <p> Nod Krai, also known as the Borderlands, is an autonomous region of Snezhnaya that is located at the southernmost area of their land and at the very edge of Teyvat. 
                It has no ruling archon, and instead the people of the Frostmoon Scions worship the Moon Maiden they consider to be their Goddess. Nod Krai’s land is made up of remnants of a moon that failed to form properly and instead fell into the oceans, eventually turning into islands with harsh environments which the people found their way around. 
                Some natives of Nod Krai have special abilities gained from using a special power called kuuvahki that is drawn from the moon, a primordial power that predates even the seven elements of Teyvat. 
                Nod Krai, due to its location near the edge of Teyvat, was unfortunately one of the first nations to be attacked by the Abyss after the Cataclysm of Khaenriah. </p>
