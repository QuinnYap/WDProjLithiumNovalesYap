        <h2> Sumeru </h2> 

        <section>
            <h3> Overview & Short History: </h3>
            <p> Sumeru is the current largest region on the surface of Teyvat, boasting an immense stretch of land that could rival the size of Mondstadt and Liyue combined. 
                Half of this region is full of lush rainforests and greenery where countless species of flora and fauna reside, while the other half is a desert with harsh conditions that are not necessarily fit for human habitation. 
                Its designs are based on Middle Eastern countries like Persia and India, with multiple themes related to ancient Mesopotamia And Sumeria. 
                Staying true to its name as the Nation of Wisdom, Sumeru is renowned as Teyvat’s center of learning due to housing the largest known academic center named Sumeru Akademiya located in the main city of Sumeru where scholars all across Teyvat strive to get accepted into. 
                The main deity worshipped in the region is the God of Wisdom Lesser Lord Kusanali, causing Sumeru’s culture to revolve around studying and research. 
                However, due to academics being one of the most important aspects of a Sumerian’s life and how much wisdom and rationality is valued here, most of its citizens especially in the capital city pride themselves in not dreaming for anything beyond the bounds of anything academic related, leading to numerous problems arising within their system which the Traveller eventually helps in resolving. </p>
