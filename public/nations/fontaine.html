        <h2> Fontaine </h2> 

        <section>
            <h3> Overview & Short History: </h3>
            <p> Fontaine is known to be the hub of culture and arts in Teyvat, with designs inspired by the Industrial Era. 
                According to the Steambird, which is the official newspaper of the Court of Fontaine (capital city of Fontaine), Fontaine is at the very center of Teyvat and is the source of all waters in the continent. 
                The land of Fontaine has a unique structure, due to its whole continental plate being lifted up into the sky, with waterfalls falling off of its ledge hundreds of meters high down into the oceans below. 
                This is the only region where the Traveller (player, not lore-based) can swim and dive deep beneath its water without drowning. 
                Fontaine boasts its modern technological systems and talented inventors who are known all over Teyvat, such as Xavier who helped in the construction and maintenance of the Mikage Furnace in Inazuma, and Alain Guillotin who invented kinetic cores called the Arkhe energy system which was then used by the Fontanians in mechanisms and combat. 
                The Hydro Archon, the Archon of Justice rules over Fontaine, however, we discover after an investigation that the current “Archon” we know of is actually a fake and the true archon eventually sacrificed her life to save Fontaine from a disastrous prophecy shortly after the discovery of her plan.
