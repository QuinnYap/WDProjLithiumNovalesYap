        <h2> Liyue </h2> 

        <section>
            <h3> Overview & Short History: </h3>
            <p> Liyue is known as the Nation of Contracts, boasting wealth and bountiful resources achieved from being the economic hub of Teyvat. 
                The region's designs are mostly inspired from traditional Chinese culture, where most of its inhabitants live in small, scattered villages outside of the main city, called Liyue Harbor which is situated in the Sea of Clouds. 
                Unlike Mondstadt's lush plains, it is a relatively rocky region that is not as suitable for farming and agriculture. Nevertheless, inhabitants of the Qingce Village worked their way around the terrain and built rice terraces contributing to the wealth of their Nation. 
                Adepti --------
                Liyue is governed by the Liyue Qixing, a committee made up of seven business leaders and merchants who are specialized in the commerce and trade sectors. Their job is to implement the policies of the Geo Archon and manage the region of Liyue. 
                Every year, one member of the Qixing is selected to perform the Rite of Decension, where the Geo Archon appears in his dragon-qilin form and gives predictions that shape business trends to aid Liyue for that year. 
                However, when the Traveller first enters this region, the Geo Archon appears to have died sue to unknown circumstances, which we later on find out that it had been staged by the Geo Archon himself to test the capabilities of the Liyue Qixing and the Adepti's capabilities to govern themselves whithout his help.
