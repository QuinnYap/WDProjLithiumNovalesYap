        <h2> Mondstadt </h2> 

        <section>
            <h3> Overview & Short History: </h3>
            <p> Mondstadt is known as the “City of Freedom”, and the region's designs are mostly inspired from Germanic culture with open landscapes outside the gates of the main city. 
                It is also known for its rich culture with cheerful music, festivals, and a strong sense of community among its people. 
                It is a region that values individuality and its inhabitants possess a free spirited nature, which is also a reflection of how their archon rules over them. The city is protected by the Anemo Archon, Barbatos, who is known for his refusal to take direct control over his land, instead choosing to watch over and protect it in secret, wandering around the area secretly as a bard. 
                It is also the region where the Traveller (the player) starts in, where they first meet with Paimon (a travel guide) and begin their journey on one of the sandy beaches of the Starfell Valley area towards the main city.</p>
