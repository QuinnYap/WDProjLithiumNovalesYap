        <h2> Natlan </h2> 

        <section>
            <h3> Overview & Short History: </h3>
            <p> Natlan is known to be the Nation of War ruled by the Pyro Archon Mavuika, located at the far western side of Teyvat, just right after Sumeru’s large stretch of deserts. 
                It is the only known place where dragons are a common sight to be found in people’s daily lives, as they are descendants of Natlan’s native species of dragons called saurians. 
                Instead of having one big main city with villages scattered around the rest of the region, Natlan is instead divided into 6 major tribes: the Children of Echoes consisting mostly of miners and craftsmen, the Scions of the Canopy with skilled hunters and explorers, the People of the Springs who are known for their great tourism, the Flower-Feather Clan who are responsible for patrolling Natlan due to their rare ability of being able to bond well to flying saurians called Qucusaurs, the Masters of the Night-Wind who are known for their mysterious shamans and their close connection with the Night Kingdom, and lastly the Collective of Plenty who live right at the foot of the Volcano of Tollan in Atocpan who are known for their great agriculture and their unique tradition of hosting bodybuilding competitions. 
                However, one of the many reasons for their nickname as the Nation of War is due to their never-ending battles with the forces of the Abyss that had been going on for 500+ years due to their damaged ley-lines until the Traveller and some other people stepped in. 
                Unlike the other nations, Natlan’s archons are all mortal, so once the previous archon has passed away, the people conduct difficult trials where they choose the best contender to be the next heir to the pyro archon title.
