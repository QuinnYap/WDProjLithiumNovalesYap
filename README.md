## Description
This website is a fan-made collection of pages discussing the lore about the seven nations of Teyvat, the main world in Genshin Impact. This includes important characters and events in the nation, the main element of the nation, a brief overview of the history, and the enemies you can find there as well. There are also fun quizzes you can answer about certain aspects of the lore or of a certain nation, just to tickle your brain, or for die-hard Genshin enthusiasts.

## Website Outline

**Homepage:** 

This webpage is the main page, which lets the user navigate to four other pages, _About_, _Nations_, _Quizzes_, and _Sources_. There will also be a _Theme_ toggle that has buttons you can press. These buttons represent different times of the day, and you can press them to change the theme of the website. Javascript will be used to implement this.

**About:** 

This webpage will display a description of Genshin Impact, the game developers, when it was made, and its latest update. It will also display a short introduction of the pair who made the project, and why we made the project as well.

**Nations:** 

This webpage displays a menu that allows users to navigate to the different sub-webpages of the seven regions in Teyvat. This means that there will be _seven more_ sub-webpages showing these nations. To enumerate, these are the seven regions of Teyvat: Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, Natlan, and Snezhaya. For all nation sub-webpages, a general format is described below.

_General Format for each Region Sub-Webpage:_ 

Each region sub-webpage will contain a photo gallery of playable characters important to the nation, and a short description of their backstory, importance, and main weapon when you click on the picture. It will also contain a brief history of the region, and its state at the time that the traveller and Paimon arrive. Since each nation all have signature elements, a description of the main element and its uses will also be in the sub-webpage. The map of the area will be shown, and there will be waypoints that you can click that show a description of an important event that happened in the location of the waypoint. These click-to-reveal information bits will be implemented using Javascript.

**Quizzes:** 

This webpage will contain links to sub-webpages containing quizzes on Genshin Impact trivia, Nation trivia, and character trivia. For the answer-check mechanic, Javascript will be used. The user will put their answers in a box, and when submitted, will be automatically checked for the correct answer. The tally of scores will also be counted via JS code.

**Sources:** 

This webpage will contain links to the credible reference sources to be used for collecting various genshin impact-related information.
